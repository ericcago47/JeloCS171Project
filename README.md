# LessSmart Branch

Less intelligent than current DraftAI but did not crash with 100,000 worlds it was tested with. 
Scores about 120-125. 
Modified heuristic in findBestMove() to select the move with the lowest cost -->the move with the least amount of turns which means the agent does not explore the board as much.
